        "As you are hike up the mountain, you are traveling in <code>positive</code> direction of integer.",
        "When you descend, you are going <code>negative</code> direction of integer.  Negative numbers are denoted with minus sign (<code> - </code>) infront of it.  For positive integers, there is no need to put plus sign (<code> + </code>) in front of it.",
        "Let's take look at some examples of integers: <code> -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 </code>"  Note that integers are not fractions nor numbers with decimal points (ex of what is not integer: <code> [ frac{1}{2} ], 1.2 </code>",
